               Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits,
                human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem 
                healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, 
                for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, 
                shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things. Many shades may be seen in nature, 
                contributing to the planets beauty. Along with humans, animals and birds also find their habitat 
                and means of survival in nature. Therefore, it is essential to take proper care of our nature to 
                maintain a healthy life.

               Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of
                religious traditions. The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. 
                All of the elements are linked. Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process 
                natural materials for use in todays ever-changing world and destroy their rawness and 
                individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the 
                environment is deteriorating. Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the 
                air and water. The oxygen produced by a single fully-grown tree is enough to supply ten people, 
                and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town.
                 Nature is a healer, and it is the foundation for many industries. Nature, on the other hand, 
                 is both a giver and a taker, according to legends. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and
                  cyclones are examples of natural calamities. These disasters, which occur as a result of natural
                   causes, have resulted in significant damage. The benefits of sunlight and fresh air to our
                    health cannot be overstated. Nature has a variety of beneficial effects on our bodies. For 
                    recuperation and vacations, people choose natural settings. People prefer to raise their 
                    children in the countryside in the United States. Their primary goal is to introduce their 
                    children to the benefits of natural beauty.
